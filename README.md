# Procrasti-Not
## Introduction
Procrasti-Not is your friendly neighbourhood bot for your procrastination misfortunes.<br>As many of us struggle with keeping on track with the tasks we've set out for ourselves on a specific day, I decided to create a "friend" that helps decide the order the tasks will be completed and also offers incentive to do so.<br>

The app is developed in Python and presented in a web browser using the Code Institute Python Template which creates a mock terminal.<br><br>

## UX
### Strategy
Procrasti-Not is intended to be a helpful tool for individuals struggling to keep on track with tasks set out for the day. <br>Many times, I find that the issue with procrastination stems from the inability to decide what to do, when. Procrasti-Not will help the user with this issue in a fun and engaging way, to hopefully allow the user to feel more time efficient throughout their day. 

#### User Stories
* As a user I want an app that makes managing my tasks efficiently easier
* As a user I want help with choosing which task to perform
* As a user I want the app to feel friendly, helpful and personalized
* As a user I want clear instructions about the app functions
* As a user I want to be able to see how many tasks remain
* As a user I want task completion to feel rewarding
* As a user I want to be able to view, edit, add and delete tasks

### Scope
In order for the tool to provide the user with the functionality and experience set out in the User Stories, I intend to write the information printed to the user in a "conversational" way, where the user is being guided, coached and cheered on by a friendly bot named Procrasti-Not. <br><br>    In addition to this, I plan to include the following features:
* A detailed "How it works" text that the user can choose to read
* An initial setup function that allows the user to enter multiple tasks at once
* A function that randomly choses a task for the user
* A function that, upon user confirmation, marks the current task as completed
* A completion tracker that informs the user how many tasks remain
* Functions that allows the user to view, edit, add and delete tasks

### Structure

#### Application Logic
Once the features of the app were identified, the next step was to plan the application logic.

This involved breaking down the app into 3 main tasks, as well as identifying the steps that the user would take to complete and navigate between each task, including mapping out any and all sub tasks that would be required. This step was crucial in understanding the flow of the app, and how each section would connect to the other. 

The flow of the app was originally sketched out using pen and paper, but I later used [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) for a more visually presentable flow chart which you can see below.

In addition to the above, I found that the app worked smoother if an "escape option" was added in to every user input. The user can at any point of the app input a zero (0) to be brought back to the SETUP MENU.

### Skeleton and Surface
#### Text Layouts
Due to the nature of the project, in which the webpage layout and design is not a factor, I still wanted the application to look inviting. I therefore sketched the look of the main menus beforehand, simply by using [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/), in order for the information that the user gains at any one particular view to be easily interpreted.

I chose to make clear divides between menu headers, general information and user interaction options.

Below you'll find screenshots of the mockup layouts.

#### Chromatics
Potential. WIP.
